# ava2022: The trouble with classification images.

## Abstract

Classification images (Ahumada, A. J 1996 Perception 26 18) are a technique for deriving the “perceptual templates” used by human observers, on the assumption that observers are linear cross-correlators. In a re-analysis of some recent data (McIlhagga, W 2021 Vision Research 182 36-45), I find that the classification images for detection experiments give a remarkably poor account of how observers detected the stimuli, contra RF Murray et al. (2005 Journal of Vision 5(2)). The implied psychometric functions for the classification images are not steep enough, they are far too efficient, and their internal noise is far too high, compared to humans.

Classification Images work better as explanations of human performance when efficiency is reasonably high; in the above study however human efficiency was remarkably low. Here I present some different models, including rectified templates, convolutional templates, and squaring, together with open software for fitting and evaluating them. Most of these models provide better accounts of human detection in this experiment than classification images, but important discrepancies remain. I believe that an explanation of such data remains an open question, and good models of trial-by-trial human performance in many cases remain to be discovered.
